# Cline Rules:

This document outlines the core rules and conventions for developing the Looped project. Adherence to these rules is crucial for maintaining code quality, consistency, and project velocity.

### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.MD`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the Looped project's architecture, tech stack (React, LangGraph.js, Supabase), overall goals, UI/UX design philosophy, and constraints.
- **Consult `PRD.MD` (Product Requirements Document)** for detailed feature specifications, user stories, and technical considerations.
- **Check `TASK.MD`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.MD` and evident in existing project code. Reference the design philosophy notes in the frontend code.

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity (Frontend - React)
- **Never create a React component file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into smaller, reusable components, custom hooks, or utility functions.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules/folders**, typically grouped by feature (e.g., `auth`, `inbox`, `onboarding`) or responsibility (e.g., `components`, `hooks`, `services`, `utils`, `contexts`).
- **Use clear, consistent imports.** Prefer named imports. Use absolute imports for modules defined in `src` (e.g., `import MyComponent from 'src/components/MyComponent';`) and relative imports for files within the same module/feature.
- **Adhere to the Design Philosophy comments** found within the existing frontend code regarding UI consistency (e.g., Tailwind gray-200 for primary background, rounded corners, subtle drop shadows).

### 🔗 Code Structure & Modularity (Backend - Supabase Edge Functions / LangGraph.js)
- **LangGraph.js graphs should be well-defined and modular.** Each node should have a clear, single responsibility.
- **Supabase Edge Functions should be concise and focused.** If a function becomes too complex, consider breaking it into smaller, invokable functions or leveraging LangGraph for orchestration. Max 500 lines per function file.
- **Organize Edge Functions logically** within the `supabase/functions/` directory, potentially grouping related functions.

### 🧪 Testing & Reliability
- **Always create unit/integration tests for new features or significant logic changes.**
    - For **React components:** Use **Jest/Vitest** with **React Testing Library**.
    - For **Supabase Edge Functions & LangGraph.js logic:** Use **Jest/Vitest** or Deno's built-in test runner if more appropriate for the Supabase environment. Mock Supabase client calls and external API (e.g., LLM) calls.
- **After updating any logic**, review and update existing tests as necessary.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` or `/__tests__` folder** mirroring the main app structure (e.g., `src/components/__tests__/MyComponent.test.tsx`, `supabase/functions/__tests__/my-function.test.ts`).
- Include at least:
    - 1 test for the primary expected use case.
    - 1-2 edge case tests (e.g., empty inputs, unusual but valid inputs).
    - 1 failure case test (e.g., invalid inputs, expected errors).
- For UI components, test for:
    - Correct rendering based on props.
    - User interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
    - State changes and their effects on the UI.

### 🎨 Style & Conventions (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Use TypeScript** as the primary language for both frontend (React) and backend (Supabase Edge Functions).
- **Follow standard TypeScript best practices.** Utilize strong typing wherever possible.
- **Format code with `Prettier`**. Ensure Prettier is configured in the project and run it before committing.
- **Lint code with `ESLint`**. Adhere to the project's ESLint configuration (e.g., rules for React hooks, accessibility).
- **Data Validation:**
    - For **Supabase Edge Function API request/response bodies:** Use **Zod** for schema definition and validation.
    - For **frontend forms:** Utilize libraries like **React Hook Form** with Zod for validation if complex, or built-in HTML5 validation for simpler forms.
- **API Interaction (Frontend):** Use the Supabase JavaScript client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`) for all interactions with Supabase services (Auth, Database, Storage, Functions).
- **State Management (Frontend):** Primarily use React's built-in state (`useState`, `useReducer`) and Context API. For more complex global state, consider solutions like Zustand as mentioned in `PRD.MD`.
- **Write JSDoc comments for every function, component props, and complex logic blocks** using a consistent style (e.g., TSDoc):
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Brief summary of the function or component.
   * @param param1 - Description of param1.
   * @param {string} param2 - Description of param2 (if type isn't obvious from TS).
   * @returns Description of the return value or JSX element.
   * @throws {ErrorType} Description of error thrown.
   * @example
   * ```tsx
   * const result = myFunction('test');
   * ```
   */
  function myFunction(param1: string): boolean {
    // ...
  }
:shield: Supabase Specific Rules
Always implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies on Supabase tables to ensure strict tenant isolation. Data for one client company must NOT be accessible to another.
Write efficient Supabase queries. Use appropriate indexing. Be mindful of the number of reads/writes, especially for real-time subscriptions.
Securely manage Supabase API keys and service role keys. Never commit them directly to the repository. Use environment variables.
Leverage Supabase Realtime Subscriptions for live updates in the UI (e.g., new chat messages, inbox status changes) as specified in the PRD.MD.
:brain: LangGraph.js Specific Rules
Clearly document the purpose of each node and edge in a LangGraph graph, either via comments or accompanying markdown.
Ensure error handling within LangGraph nodes to prevent entire graph failures.
Manage state within LangGraph effectively. Be explicit about what data is passed between nodes.
Design for observability: Log key decisions and transitions within the graph for easier debugging.
:books: Documentation & Explainability
Update  when new features are added, dependencies change, environment variables are modified, or setup/build/deployment steps are altered.
Comment non-obvious code sections to ensure clarity for other developers (and your future self).
When writing complex logic, add an inline  explaining the why behind a particular implementation choice, not just the what.
Ensure all UI components and their props are understandable, leveraging TypeScript interfaces/types.
:robot_face: AI Behavior Rules (for cline)
Never assume missing context. Ask clarifying questions if uncertain about requirements, design, or implementation details.
Never hallucinate libraries, functions, or Supabase features. Only use documented and verified packages/APIs.
Always confirm file paths, component names, and module names exist or are consistent with project structure before referencing them.
Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed to or if it's part of a refactoring task clearly defined in TASK.MD.
When asked to implement UI, refer to the existing frontend code for styling cues, component structure, and design philosophy.
Prioritize security, especially tenant isolation with Supabase RLS, in all backend logic.

# Cline's Memory Bank

I am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode

### Act Mode
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
